# hodgepodge
Spigot Minecraft Plugin, which adds many unrelated things.

Main features can be can be divided into:

1) Inventory:  
  • Armor autoequip (while pickup armor with better material)  
  • Autoreplacing broken items (and saving renamed/mending items)  
  • When drinking potions bottle goes into inventory.  
  • Within a second after closing the chest on a swap of hands (F by default), all the contents are thrown in the sight direction.  
2) Decorative:  
  • Cleaning colored blocks in the cauldron.  
  • Turning concrete powder into concrete by cauldron (and by click on it).  
  • Recoloring blocks by right-click on block (with dye in hand).  
  • Rotate(and more) blocks with any hoe.  
3) Gameplay changes:  
  • More fall protection by jumping potion.  
  • Smelting armor gives a nugget for each ingot in armor. (vanilla crafts are removed)  
  • Fireworks fly vertically upwards and do not deflect. (controversial update, for mechanisms with the activation of something above)  
  • Shared enderchests / enderchest groups. One enderchest inventory for several people. There are also channels without administrators and entry restrictions.  
  • When you join the game in the portal, you would be teleported from the portal, this allows players to log in using AuthMe.  
  • Boats teleport out of the portals, so boats do not get stuck in it and do not prevent players from entering.  
  • Diamond blocks frighten monsters, and blocks spawn of thrm while red-powered.  
  • Dispensers can fill cauldrons by buckets.  
  • Dispensers can feed animals in the block in front of them.  
  • Pumps like IndustrialCraft and BuildCraft pumps, which are dispensers with a special core inside. To work requires nether fences as a pipe, empty buckets to fill and at least one block of fluid beneath.  
  • A player with a saddle on his head (/hat - see “Commands” in ThirdEye(my another plugin)) can sit on his head.  
  • You can leash players, but they may free themselves with sneaking.  
  • Storages  
  • Bosses (in progress)  
4) Craft changes:  
  • Clay craft.  
  • Sandstone into sand, redsand, slabs and stairs into blocks, pocket borsch, chorus from chorus flower and more.  
  • All crafts are added to the craft book.  
5) Commands:  
  • "/ec" or "/enderchest" — interaction with channels (groups) of ender chests (EC), full autocompletion on Tab.  
  • "/boss" — spawning, reconfiguring and removing bosses.
